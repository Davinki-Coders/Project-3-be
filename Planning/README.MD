### Major Hurdles

## Rodrigo Pereira
- Logins persisting after a page refresh or going to a url within the same app using the browser’s address bar.

- Auto closing the navigation bar on a link click. Since it’s an npm package using state to manipulate it isn’t working as intended.

## Rashawn Gordon

- In my other project I wished I utilized more of the react-features / packages we installed for this project. One of my goals was to figure out the react-carousel feature. When I first attempted to do the carousel for this project I installed one that was extremely limited for sizing and scaling purposes. Rodrigo introduced other react-carousel to me and we decided to go with the nuka-carousel installment which was fun — thus I overcome a hudle and added a beautiful feature to the project.

## Neely Neverson

- A hurdle for me was bug finding. Everytime I resolved an bug another one popped up. It was very fustrating and at times I found it hard to remain patient. I found it helpful to step away from my machine and take a breather. Doing so helped me to clear my mind after which I was able to reframe the issue and tackle it at another perspective.
